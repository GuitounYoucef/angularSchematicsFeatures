# ðŸ”§ Angular Schematics Library for Feature-Based Development

A custom Angular schematics library that accelerates the development of Angular applications by generating predefined, modular features using a single CLI command. Built with **Clean Architecture** principles and following the **Modelâ€“Viewâ€“ViewModel (MVVM)** pattern, this library helps enforce consistency, scalability, and maintainability across your projects.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This library is designed to:

- Reduce Angular development time
- Provide a clean and scalable application structure
- Automate feature creation such as:
  - `core`
  - `auth`
  - `posts`
  - `ui-feature`
  - etc.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

The schematics are based on:
- **Clean Architecture**: separation of concerns into `domain`, `data`, and `presentation` layers
- **MVVM Pattern**: encourages a clear separation between the UI and business logic
